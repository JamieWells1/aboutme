        <h2>The official portfolio of Jamie Wells.</h2>
        <p>This website was entirely built by Jamie Wells using HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>I am currently writing this at 17 years old, I am about to finish my first year of sixth form, studying Maths, Physics, and Spanish, 
            and have recently started to learn full-stack web development.

        <h2>Past Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Web Development on Wix</h3></li>
            My first project was building a no-code website for an ecommerce brand using Wix Website Builder. This took approximately 4 months, and 
            included Home, Shop, About, FAQ, Contact, and Return pages.<br />
            <a href="./public/wix-screenshots.html">View the UI/UX of the website here.</a>

            <li><h3>Spanish Course Development on LearnWorlds</h3></li>
            This project involved me using LearnWorlds to host and design my eLearning site. Both the website and course were built using the LearnWorlds 
            website builder, featuring a course with 1000+ questions and activities, and webpages for the Home, Features, and Pricing tabs. This project 
            was completely a solo-effort.<br />
